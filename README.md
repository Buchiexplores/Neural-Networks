# Neural-Networks

In this exercise, logistic regression and neural networks was used to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9).
"Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. 
This exercise will show you how the methods you’ve learned can be used for this classification task."
